:Description: Start over with Sphinx setup.

:Purpose: Run to reset after major documentation changes.

:Usage: ``docsetup``

:Notes:

* This runs the command to add new rst files. Run for new docs.
* Run from the project dir: Desktop\\simpleth
* Delete .rst file from source if a file is renamed or deleted.

Beware, I have not used this for awhile.
Not really sure if it is needed nor if it would be
over-destructive.
