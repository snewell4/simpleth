TestNeverDeployed
*****************
:Description: TestNeverDeployed

:Purpose:  Used with PyTest test cases that attempt to use a contract without doing a connect().  This contract should never be deployed.

:Notes:  For test use, this contract should be compiled but should not have a address file (`.addr`) in the `artifacts` directory.
